        This is an appliance I use everyday. An Electric Kettle is used for boiling water. It has a 
        cover, spout outlet, safety handle, switch and non-slip base with a waterproof valve. The kettle 
        automatically switches off when the water reaches boiling point. It allows the users to heat water 
        to a boiling point in 2-3 minutes, It increases safety, can take with the user where they go and it 
        saves energy.
        The most common type of electric kettle is a stainless steel electric kettle. Electric kettles come 
        in other materials including copper, metal, or plastic. The material of the electric kettle usually 
        determines the longevity and price. Electric kettles are made in a round shape that resembles a globe 
        that holds water.
        Stainless steel electric kettles last longer than other types of electric kettles because they are durable 
        and can withstand high temperatures. Because stainless steel electric kettles last longer than other types 
        of electric kettles, they also cost more. Electric kettles come in all different sizes, with the size 
        directly affecting how much water you can heat at one time.
        Electric kettles can be a good option for people who want to be more environmentally aware, as they tend 
        to be more energy-efficient than heating gas on an electric stovetop. Electric kettles are also more 
        cost-effective than heating water with a gas stove.
