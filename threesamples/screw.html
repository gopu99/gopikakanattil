        A screw is a most commonly used simple machine to hold objects together, mainly objects such as 
        wood and to position the objects. Often screws have a head on one end of it, the head is usually 
        larger than the body. The other end is a sharp tip and is mainly used for drilling into wood, 
        plastic, stone,etc.Its body shape is cylindrical with an  inclined plane wrapped around. 

        Screws change a gentle turning force into a strong forward force. They do this with a spiral 
        pattern called a “thread” , which runs round and round the screw from the wide top to the narrow 
        end. Each time the screw is turned, the thread pulls it a short distance along. The force required 
        to move the screw forward is spread out all along the length of the thread.
