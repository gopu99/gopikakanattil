                        <P>
                            Serving a dessert is the real culmination of the 
                            evening. Children and adults are waiting 
                            impatiently for dessert. We bake the cake and 
                            prepare the cream as you want, using only natural
                            ingredients of high quality. Putting the base cake.

                            We are awaiting for the biscuits to infuse and 
                            soak. We think over the design, the colour scheme
                            and every detail of the cake and proceed to the 
                            decor.
