            <h1>About the Article</h1>
            <p>
                The article is about the history of the pencil. It starts with mentioning about the british library 
                exhibition writing , Making your mark, which tells the story of how writing evolved over the last 
                5000 years.

                Later about the 3 pieces of lead. These were used in the last couple of centuries as a tool for 
                writing mainly by school children, notes takers, artist, etc. During the middle age period leads 
                were used for drawing manuscripts. And also in earlier times people used lead to sketch out lines 
                which was overwritten by ink or paint.

                Furthermore, An ancient drawing technique known as silverpoint is discussed. This was used during 
                the late gothic or the early Renaissance period. It is also lighter than a lead. Even though, 
                silverpoint is one variety of metal point, it cannot be easily erased, which leads to the widespread 
                of graphite.

                The word pencile originated from the French word pincel, and Latin penicillus or a little tail. The 
                modern pencile was invented in 1795 by Nicholas-Jacques conte. Conteâ€™s original methode for producing 
                pencils involved roasting a mixture of water clay and graphite at 1900 degrees fahrenheit in a kiln. 
                Depending on the purpose of the pencil, the surround can be square, polygonal, or round.

                Finally, the graphite was discovered in Europe for the first time in the early 15th century, in bavaria. 
                In 1564, the purest deposits of lump graphite were discovered in the late district. During the 19th 
                century, a significant pencil manufacturing industry grew up around keswick. Cumblerand pencils were 
                the best because the graphite left no dust and clearly marked the paper.
